### What are the advantages of using CSS preprocessors?

#### Answer

There are many advantages of using CSS preprocessors. Firstly, they allow us to write more maintainable and scalable CSS overall. Secondly, they provide syntax for easy to write nested selectors as well as variables for consistent theming. CSS preprocessors also allow us to write mixins to generate repeated CSS. On top of everything, they let us split code into multiple files (without needing to make HTTP request for each one).
