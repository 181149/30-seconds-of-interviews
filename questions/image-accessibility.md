### What is the purpose of `alt` attribute on images?

#### Answer

The `alt` attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user cannot view it. If the image is for decorative purposes only, the `alt` attribute should be empty. On the other hand, if image contains information the `alt` attribute should describe image.
