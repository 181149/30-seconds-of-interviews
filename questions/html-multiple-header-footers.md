### Can a web page contain multiple <header> elements? What about <footer> elements?

#### Answer

Yes to both. The W3 documents state that the tags represent the header(`<header>`) and footer(`<footer>`) areas of their nearest ancestor "section". So not only can the page `<body>` contain a header and a footer, but so can every `<article>` and `<section>` element. 

#### Good to hear

* W3 recommends having as many as you want, but only 1 of each for each "section" of your page, i.e. body, section etc.
