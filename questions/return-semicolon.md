### What does the following function return?

```js
function greet() {
    return
    {
      message: 'hello'
    }
}
```

#### Answer

Because of JavaScript's automatic semicolon placement compiler places a semicolon after `return` keyword and therefore it returns `undefined` without single error being thrown.

#### Good to hear

* Automatic semicolon placement can lead to time-consuming bugs
* Even though semicolons are optional in JavaScript, you should use them
