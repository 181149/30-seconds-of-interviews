### What is CORS?

#### Answer

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or CORS is a mechanism which aims to allow requests made on behalf of you and at the same time block some requests made by rogue JavaScript and is triggered whenever you are making an HTTP request to a different: domain, sub-domain, port and protocol.

#### Good to hear

* CORS behavior is not an error,  it’s a mechanism that’s working as expected in order to protect your users
