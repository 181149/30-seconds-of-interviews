### What are the advantages of using CSS sprites and how would one utilize them?

#### Answer

CSS sprites combine multiple images into one image, limiting the amount of HTTP requests a browser has to make, thus improving load times.

To utilize a spritesheet in CSS, one would use certain properties, such as `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` to ultimately alter the `background` of a CSS selector or an element.
