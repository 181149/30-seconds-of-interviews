### What is a closure?

#### Answer

A closure is a function defined inside another function and has access to its lexical scope even when it is executing outside its lexical scope. The closure has access to variables in three scopes:

* Variables declared in its own scope
* Variables declared in the scope of the parent function
* Variables declared in the global scope

#### Good to hear

* Closures are useful because they let you associate data with a function that operates on that data.
* A closure can substitute an object with only a single method.
* Closures can be used to emulate private methods.
