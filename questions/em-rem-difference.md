### What is the difference between `em` and `rem` units?

#### Answer

Both `em` and `rem` units are based on the `font-size` attribute and the only difference is from where they inherit their values. `em` units inherit their value from the font size of the parent element while `rem` units inherit their value from the root element. In most browsers the `font-size` of root element is set to `16px`.
