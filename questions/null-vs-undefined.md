### What are the differences between `null` and `undefined`?

#### Answer

In JavaScript, two values discretely represent nothing - `undefined` and `null`. When value of the variable is not defined it is `undefined`. On the other hand, `null` means empty or non-existent value which is used by programmers to indicate “no value”.

* [MDN docs for null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null)
* [MDN docs for undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined)

#### Good to hear

* `typeof undefined` returns `undefined`
* `typeof null` returns `object`. However, it is still a primitive value
* `undefined == null` equals to `true`
